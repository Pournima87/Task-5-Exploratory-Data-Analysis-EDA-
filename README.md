# Titanic Data Analysis & Survival Prediction 🚢

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced survival rates on the ill-fated voyage. Through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, this project delves into the impact of various features like passenger class, gender, age, fare, and more on the chances of survival.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages Python and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to:

- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key insights through plots and charts
- Derive meaningful conclusions based on data patterns

## 📝 Key Observations

- **Gender and Survival**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~19%).
- **Passenger Class**: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, while 3rd class passengers had the lowest.
- **Age and Survival**: Younger passengers, particularly females, had higher survival rates.
- **Fare and Survival**: Higher fare-paying passengers had a better chance of survival.

## 📑 Project Structure

- **Titanic_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis and visualizations.
- **Titanic Dataset Report.pdf**: A detailed PDF report summarizing key findings.


### Insights and Conclusion
The data analysis highlights that gender and passenger class were significant factors in determining survival chances. The "women and children first" protocol likely influenced survival rates, and higher-class passengers had easier access to lifeboats.

## 🔧 Requirements
